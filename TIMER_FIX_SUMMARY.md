## 🔧 **Fixed: New Queue Timer Issue**

### **❌ Problem:**
New queues were showing "Your turn is now!" immediately even when admin hadn't clicked "Call Queue" button.

### **✅ Solution:**

#### **1. Frontend Fix (queue-status.html):**
- **Removed elapsed time calculation** that was incorrectly subtracting time for new queues
- **Fixed countdown logic** to only show "Your turn is now!" when actually called
- **Added proper status checking** to distinguish between waiting and called states
- **Improved display text** to show "Waiting..." instead of "Your turn is now!" for non-called queues

#### **2. Backend Fix (backend.py):**
- **Added position-based wait time calculation:**
  - Available: 5 minutes + (position-1) × 5 minutes
  - Busy: 8 minutes + (position-1) × 7 minutes  
  - Away: 999 minutes (unknown)
- **Added position_in_queue field** to API response
- **Better queue ordering** by creation time

### **🎯 Now Works Correctly:**

1. **New Queue Created** → Shows proper wait time based on position (e.g., "~10 minutes" if 2nd in line)
2. **Admin Clicks "Call Queue"** → Status changes to "🔴 You are now being called!"
3. **Countdown reaches 0** → Only shows "Your turn is now!" if actually called
4. **Admin Status Changes** → Wait times update accordingly (busy = longer, away = unknown)

### **📊 Wait Time Examples:**
- **1st in line (Available)**: ~5 minutes
- **2nd in line (Available)**: ~10 minutes  
- **1st in line (Busy)**: ~8 minutes
- **2nd in line (Busy)**: ~15 minutes
- **Any position (Away)**: "Unknown time"

The queue system now accurately reflects real wait times and only shows "being called" when the admin actually calls the queue!
